3. Dedicated Trainee Developer with over 10 days of successul experience in Programming. My main goal is to get extensive knowledge on how JavaScript works.
4. Pascal ABC during the school time. HTML & CSS basics, a bit of JS practice.   
5. JavaScript code e.g:
> ```
> let obj = {
>     width: 200,
>     height: 300,
>     title: "My menu"
> }
> function multiplyNumeric(obj) {
>     for (let key in obj) {
>         if (typeof obj[key] == 'number') {
>             obj[key] *= 2
>         }
>    }
> }
> multiplyNumeric(obj)
> 
> alert('Menu width=' + obj.width + ' height=' + obj.height + ' title=' + obj.title)
> ```
